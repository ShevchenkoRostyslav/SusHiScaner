1. Project Goals:

Project is designed as universal tool to work with SusHi
(for "Supersymmetric Higgs") [0] interfaced with 2HDMC [1], in particular to
submit huge amount of jobs using any of the available in SusHi basises
( WARNING: only lambda and physical are supported right now). Moreover - tools to
produce human readable .txt file with scans and .root file with TTree for
analisers are available.

2. System architecture/infrastructure

Project have to be able to run at CERN (lxplus), DESY (naf) and private laptops
Should be compatible with Python, v >= 2.7, SusHi v >= 1.5.0.

3. User dialogs and the Control flow

User should interact with a tool ONLY via:
- setup.py - setup file, where user should specify basis and user-defined
algorithm to determine poi.
- project.py - to submit jobs
- postproceessor.py - to process the output of the project.
